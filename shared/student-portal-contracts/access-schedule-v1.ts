 * Agendamentos de acesso (owner decisions 2026-09-27). Each level (school, class, student) may keep
 * its own access: a switch plus scheduled "Abrir"/"Fechar" actions. The Portal follows the agenda:
 * before a scheduled action it is in the opposite state — an "Abrir" later closes it now and opens
 * it then; a "Fechar" later opens it now and closes it then. After the last action it stays as that
 * action left it, and with no actions it is what the switch says.
 *
 * The school still prevails: a student may enter only while both the school and the student's own
 * level (class or student, when they have one) are open.
