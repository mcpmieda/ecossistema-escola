/*
 * Selos brilhantes (owner idea 27/09/2026): a trimester mark of 95% or more, reached the minimum,
 * earns the student a seal in that subject — something to collect across the year. The same rule
 * as the Brilhante band of the trimester header; recoveries never earn seals themselves.
 *
 * A red trimester mark in ANY subject means no seal in that trimester (owner decision 27/09/2026).
 * Only earned seals are ever shown: nothing locked, nothing "almost" — a missing seal is simply
 * not there. A closed trimester cannot be recovered: the year-end recovery (REC1–REC3) does not
 * count. Only a teacher correcting the mark changes it, and the rule always reads current marks.
 *
 * Seals from assessments (owner decision 28/09/2026): each of the trimester's two assessments
 * (AV1 and AV2, never activities or the parallel exam) that is Brilhante also earns a seal, so a
 * subject can hold up to three per trimester. They count only once the trimester has ended by the
 * calendar and the subject's trimester mark is out, and never in a trimester with a red mark in any
 * subject. The assessment's Brilhante tag still shows; it just does not count. The gold row of the
 * subject list stays for the trimester's own seal.
